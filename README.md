# About
This repository is meant to store my portfolio website. I thought it is useful to 
create one portfolio website for myself. I am using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
for developing this website. It has been long since I have done something only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So, I am expecting this development to be a refresher as well as an opportunity to learn the things that I had (for sure) missed earlier.
